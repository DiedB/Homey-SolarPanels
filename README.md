# Solar Panels

Let Homey monitor your solar panels. This app allows you to view production statistics using Insights, and lets you create triggers based on the current power output. For example, enable your car charger when your panels are producing!

Stating issues in reviews will not help them get resolved. If you have any issues with the app, or want to request support for another inverter brand, direct it to the issues section of GitHub: https://github.com/DiedB/Homey-SolarPanels/issues
