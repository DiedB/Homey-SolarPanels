# Solar Panels  
Let Homey monitor your solar panels. This app allows you to view production statistics using Insights, and lets you create triggers based on the current power output. For example, enable your car charger when your panels are producing!

# Features
## Current production data
Homey shows your inverter as a sensor. This app currently supports two metrics: current power and current energy production (reset daily). It uses Homey's built-in capabilities because custom capabilities are not fully working yet. This will be solved in a later version.

## Flow
Your inverter acts as a sensor for Homey. This allows you to use logic on your production data. Here is an example:

## Insights
Homey retrieves data from your inverter every five minutes, but only logs new data. You can add more than one inverter, and every inverter will be logged in a separate graph.
